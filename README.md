blazing fast reimagined nixos dotfiles because i can't escape the curse of home manager and also i made my own repository too confusing to understand

this maybe will get merged with the other one eventually or just be standalone if it's really sigma

things:
- no home manager
- no flake parts
- configure in config files not nix
- modularize
